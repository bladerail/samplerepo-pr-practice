# [Sample Repo] PR Practice
A sample repo for practicing how to create Pull Requests


First commit
I'm going to commit a second time now, to see if I'm still getting an error trying to push into origin add-intro

First two commits completed. 
Now testing Add Summary



Adding new lines for new add-intro commit

With this merge, does add-summary branch get this? Does master get this? Does add-intro get this?
