# [Sample Repo] PR Practice
A sample repo for practicing how to create Pull Requests


First commit
I'm going to commit a second time now, to see if I'm still getting an error trying to push into origin add-intro

First two commits completed. 
Now testing Add Summary



Adding new lines for new add-intro commit

With this merge, does add-summary branch get this? Does master get this? Does add-intro get this?

So I found out, add-summary gets the new text above but master and add-intro do not. I will now merge add-summary with master, then try to revert to a previous commit.

I will now add unwanted lines to a commit which I will revert later.
Unwanted line 1.
Unwanted line 2.
Unwanted line 3.
Unwanted line 4.
Unwanted line 5.
Unwanted line 6.
Unwanted line 7.
